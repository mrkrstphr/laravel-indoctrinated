> A Laravel 5 Provider for Doctrine ORM

**WARNING**: This repository is not production ready and not recommended for use. This was put together
as part of the example code for the book [Clean Architecture in PHP](https://leanpub.com/cleanphp). It is
underfeatured, undertested, and underdocumented.

This project simply wires up a basic Doctrine EntityManager for use in Laravel applications.
